### I enjoy maintaining this blog.

It's a reflection of who I am as a developer: focused, to the point and *occasionally* verbose. It is the whetstone that sharpens my writing and learning abilities, but every once in a while I feel the need to loosen up a bit. I have other interests _too_! 

### So I started a newsletter called _*Original Copy*_.

I find that it's a great way to nourish my curiosity for life, and to share that curiosity with you, dear reader! 

Every Friday I round up my most important **code-related** learnings into a quick email followed by a list of 3-5 things that I think you might find compelling:
