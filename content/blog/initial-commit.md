4th of July, 1996

The date of my life's **initial commit**. 

Coincidentally, also the day that the US [declared independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)) 
from their friends over in Europe. And what a move that was!

For a little bit more trivia: 

According to [onthisday.com](https://www.onthisday.com/date/1996/july/4) the 
29th San Diego Comic-Con International opened and Hotmail began.
Interestingly enough, @hotmail was my first email ever, and what a gem that was: 
`j34n_sonic_@hotmail.com`. You won't find one of those that often!

Anyway, without further ado, lets talk:
 
## Blog.

This little place is my wishful hope that I will start writing about things 
that interest me and - most importantly - that I want to learn about.
Topics may or may not include:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)
- Testing
- Design Patterns
- Tooling

Every once in a while I also quite enjoy learning about UI/UX and best practices.
Lately the biggest inspiration for that is [@refactoringui](https://twitter.com/refactoringui)
from the creators of [Tailwind CSS](https://twitter.com/tailwindcss)

I come from an arts background - when I was a kid, the plan was to become a professional
concept artist/illustrator. As you may have guessed, this is plan B :) /s

I would like to set at least one goal for this blog and that is:

### Write one post per month.

That's it.

Over the years I have learned that the best way to create a habit for myself is 
to start small and build from there. 

Everything you do for yourself is a marathon, not a sprint.

So take your time and do it at a steady pace. No hard commitments, no clearly
defined lines. Think of something that is flexible and manageable to do even
if things don't go too well that month.

See you soon!

Peace,

JC

p.s: I definitely didn't steal that outro from [MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/user/marquesbrownlee)
