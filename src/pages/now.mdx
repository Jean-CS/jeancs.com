I'm heavily focused on refactoring my personal website from Hugo to Gatsby. This
is taking up the majority of my focus over the last two weeks. There are a
number of things involved.

First, I had a blog over at simplemachine with some great posts that I want to
port over here.

Second, I need to make sure I don't break any of the urls I currently have on
this blog.

Third, I want to streamline the design.

4, I have new content ideas I want to spec out. With Gatsby I should be able to
do a lot more.
