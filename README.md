### This repo holds the source code for my personal website

- I built it with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) 🔥
- It's hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) 👽
- I use [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) as a build tool 🍹
- My styles are written in [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/) 💅🏻
- This isn't a Hugo theme but I did create [Hugo hotplate] (https://github.com/jakewies/hugo-hotplate) as a spin-off from this project. Go check it out! 🏋🏻‍♂️
